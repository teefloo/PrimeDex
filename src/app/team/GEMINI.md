# PrimeDex — Team Builder Module

This directory contains the core logic and UI for the Pokémon Team Builder feature of PrimeDex. It allows users to create, analyze, and share custom Pokémon teams.

## Directory Overview

This module is implemented as a Next.js route (`/team`) within the App Router architecture. It provides a highly interactive interface for managing a team of up to 6 Pokémon, with real-time feedback on type coverage, stat balance, and synergy.

## Key Files

- **`layout.tsx`**: Configures server-side metadata and SEO for the Team Builder page, including dynamic titles, descriptions, and JSON-LD structured data for search engines.
- **`page.tsx`**: The primary client component that orchestrates the team-building experience. It handles state management, data fetching, and renders complex visualizations such as the stats radar chart and type analysis panels.

## Technical Architecture

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **State Management:** Integrated with the global `usePrimeDexStore` (Zustand) to persist team selections across the application.
- **Data Fetching:** Utilizes `@tanstack/react-query` (`useQueries`) to fetch detailed data for all Pokémon in the team and their respective type relations in parallel.
- **Animations:** Uses `framer-motion` for smooth transitions when adding/removing Pokémon or switching between analysis views.
- **Visualizations:** Employs `recharts` for the stat distribution Radar chart, providing a clear overview of the team's strengths and weaknesses.
- **Analysis Engine:** Leverages `@/lib/team-analysis` to calculate defensive/offensive coverage and the overall "Synergy Score."

## Main Features

1.  **Team Management:** Add, remove, or clear the entire team (limited to 6 slots).
2.  **Type Analysis:** Detailed breakdown of team-wide weaknesses, resistances, and offensive coverage.
3.  **Synergy Scoring:** A custom algorithm that evaluates how well the selected Pokémon complement each other.
4.  **Auto-Complete Suggestions:** Uses `@/lib/api` to suggest Pokémon that fill specific type gaps in the current team.
5.  **Team Sharing:** Supports sharing teams via a generated URL code (e.g., `?code=25-6-9`) and deep-linking to load shared teams automatically.
6.  **Stat Balance Radar:** A visual representation of the team's average base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.).
7.  **Internationalization:** Fully localized in English and French using `i18next`.

## Development Conventions

- **Client-Side Interactivity:** The main page is a `'use client'` component due to its heavy reliance on state and browser APIs (URLSearchParams, navigator.share).
- **Component Pattern:** Follows a modular structure, delegating heavy logic to utility libraries in `@/lib`.
- **Responsive Design:** Uses Tailwind CSS with a mobile-first approach, featuring custom "glassmorphism" panels for the dashboard UI.
- **SEO & Accessibility:** Ensures proper ARIA labels and structured data are present for a high-quality user experience.
